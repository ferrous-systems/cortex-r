# Compile-time Support for Arm Targets

This crate looks at your build target (using the `$TARGET` environment variable
that `cargo` sets) and provides a selection of `--cfg` values to `rustc` that
might be useful.

Add to your build dependencies and make a `build.rs` file like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    arm_targets::process();
}
```

Cargo will be given configuration like this:

```text
cargo:rustc-cfg=arm_architecture="v7-r"
cargo:rustc-check-cfg=cfg(arm_architecture, values("v6-m", "v7-m", "v7e-m", "v8-m.base", "v8-m.main", "v7-r", "v8-r", "v7-a", "v8-a"))
cargo:rustc-cfg=arm_isa="A32"
cargo:rustc-check-cfg=cfg(arm_isa, values("A64", "A32", "T32"))
```

This allows you to write Rust code in your firmware like:

```rust
#[cfg(any(arm_architecture = "v7-r", arm_architecture = "v8-r"))]
```

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
