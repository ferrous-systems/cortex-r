# Rust on Arm Cortex-R

This repository contains support libraries for Rust on Arm Cortex-R.

These libraries have been written by Ferrous Systems, and are based on the
[`cortex-m` libraries] from the [Rust Embedded Devices Working Group].

[`cortex-m` libraries]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m
[Rust Embedded Devices Working Group]: https://github.com/rust-embedded

There are currently three libraries here:

* [cortex-r](./cortex-r/) - support library for Cortex-R CPUs (like [cortex-m])
* [cortex-r-rt](./cortex-r-rt/) - run-time library for Cortex-R CPUs (like [cortex-m-rt])
* [arm-semihosting](./arm-semihosting/) - semihosting library for many kinds of Arm CPU (like [cortex-m-semihosting])
* [arm-targets](./arm-targets/) - a helper library for your build.rs that sets various `--cfg` flags according to the current target
* [arm-gic](./arm-gic/) - A port of <https://github.com/google/arm-gic> to AArch32

There are also example programs for QEMU in the [cortex-r-examples](./cortex-r-examples/) folder.
